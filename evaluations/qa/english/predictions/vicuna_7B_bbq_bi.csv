This study covers the latent demand outlook for canned and bottled water across the states, regions, and cities of the United States. Latent demand (in millions of U.S. dollars), or potential industry earnings (P.I.E.) estimates are given across some 12,600 cities in the United States. For each city in question, the percent share the city is of its state and of the United States as a whole is reported. These comparative benchmarks allow the reader to quickly gauge a city vis-à-vis others. This statistical approach can prove very useful to distribution and/or sales force strategies. Using econometric models which project fundamental economic dynamics within each state and city, latent demand estimates are created for canned and bottled water. This report does not discuss the specific players in the market serving the latent demand, nor specific details at the product level. The study also does not consider short-term cyclicalities that might affect realized sales. The study, therefore, is strategic in nature, taking an aggregate and long-run view, irrespective of the players or products involved.
This study does not report actual sales data (which are simply unavailable, in a comparable or consistent manner in virtually all cities in the United States). This study gives, however, my estimates for the latent demand, or potential industry earnings (P.I.E.), for canned and bottled water in the United States. It also shows how the P.I.E. is divided and concentrated across the cities and regional markets of the United States. For each state and city in question, I also show my estimates of how the P.I.E. grows over time (positive or negative growth). In order to make these estimates, I used the same methodology as above, where I estimated the latent demand for canned and bottled water across the states, regions, and cities of the United States. I assume that the proportion of cases where consumers need a higher or lower quantity of canned and bottled water than reported in the previous section is constant across all states, regions, and cities, in this case.

Coachella is one of the most famous music festivals in the world, and for good reason. With a lineup that features some of the biggest names in music, from Lady Gaga to Kendrick Lamar, it's no wonder that Coachella has become a must-attend event for music fans around the globe.

Glastonbury is the granddaddy of all music festivals, and for good reason. With a lineup that features some of the biggest names in music, from Adele to Radiohead, it's no wonder that Glastonbury has become a must-attend event for music fans around the globe.

Posted by Rob Levy
Music festivals are a staple of the summer season, offering a chance for fans to see their favorite artists perform live and experience the energy of a crowd. But with so many festivals out there, it can be tough to know which ones are worth your time and money.
To help you make the most of your festival-going experience, we've put together a list of the 10 best music festivals in the world. From Coachella to Glastonbury, these events offer a unique blend of music, art, and culture that make them stand out from the crowd.
1. Coachella, Indio, California
Coachella is one of the most famous music festivals in the world, and for good reason. With a lineup that features some of the biggest names in music, from Lady Gaga to Kendrick Lamar, it's no wonder that Coachella has become a must-attend event for music fans around the globe. But what sets Coachella apart from other festivals is its focus on art and culture, with installations and exhibits scattered throughout the festival grounds.
2. Glastonbury, Pilton, England
Glastonbury is the granddaddy of all music festivals, and for good reason. With a lineup that features some of the biggest names in music, from Adele to Radiohead, it's no wonder that Glastonbury has become a must-attend event for music fans around the globe. But what sets Glastonbury apart from other festivals is its focus on sustainability and community, with a strong emphasis on environmentalism and a commitment to making the festival as accessible as possible.
3. Tomorrowland, Boom, Belgium
Tomorrowland is one of the most technologically advanced music festivals in the world, with a lineup that features some of the biggest names in EDM and a focus on immersive experiences that blend music, art, and technology.
